He spoke to Dolfie Ola on the leadership tussle in Nigeria. Excerpts: Q: What doesit take to lead Nigeria? A: I don't think that it takes much to lead Nigeria. And 1 don't think you need any spe- cial qualities to lead Nigeria other than what you need to lead other countries. In other words, you need the requisite leadership qualities - honesty, integrity, an idea of how to bring the country together, the disposition to perceive the coun- try 25 one single entity. Once you have that, I don't see what proolems you have. Q: Some people have been in the headship of this country without necessarily possessing these qualities, yet they were there. Why so? A: Being in leadership does not necessarily make you a leader. You can find yourself in a leadership position by one circumstance or the other. If I have a gun and I shoot my way into office, I am leading the country. But that does not nec- essarily mean that I have the leadership qualities to lead the country. So their having been there or their having found them- selves in leadership positions does not necessarily mean that they have the leadership quali- ties, that is for somebody who shoots his way into office. For people who have emerged through the ballot box, it is our fault Nigerians for having people who don't have the leadership capabilities in leadership posi- tions. We elected them and if we are today complaining that they could not lead us properly, they have shortcomings, then it is our fault because we elected them to those positions. So the prob- lem is not only the leaders but also the led who put the leaders there. Are you saying weare all guilty? A: To some extent, yes. I don't think the problem of this country is just the issue of the leaders. We all have our share of guilt. Q: Well, Chinua Achebe in his book, The Trouble Wub Nige- ria argued that \"the trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely the failure of leadership.\" And so many people think so but then, can the crisis in Nigeria be resolved mainly by getting bet- ter individuals?
